# Shoot-em-up Ghost Game

**Goal**<br> 
Avoid forest obstacles while eliminating enemy ghosts.

**Overview**<br>
A JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas game that creates an imaginary world where our hero hunts down enemy ghosts. 

**Key Activities**<br> 
I use JavaScript constructor functions and prototypes to create a mythical world of heroes, ghosts, trees and rocks. I bring the sprite characers to life using 60-frames-per-second animation on a beautiful HTML5 canvas and landscape that evokes the 1980's-era 'Legend of Zelda' game. In this multi-directional game, the player's appearance changes based on direction. Keyboard arrow keys control player movement; the spacebar controls shooting. Audio files bring game-sound to life.

**JavaScript Elements Used**<br>

- objects
- constructor functions
- prototypes
- arrays
- boolean values
- for loops
- random() Method
- Event Listeners (detect player movement when arrow keys are pressed)
- Variable Scope: Global/local variables
- setInterval()

Enjoy!<br>
